# MERN

### Fixes needed
[] Need to set up useContext to share state (concert info / form entry to remove error on change) throughout app
[] "Concert not found from API" error message not going away after change
[] Main page not refreshing after new concert has been added
[] State provided to concert list not updating without refresh.  Potentially related to above fix
[] set link for individual concerts and for individual songs.  probably on main page.
[] change from saving each individual concert to its own entry to updating the entry for that artist to contain a new concert within.
[] change from saving id as reference to artist to reference to concert and save artist id separately.
